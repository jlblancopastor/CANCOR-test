# CANCOR-test

A test to detect outlier loci based on Canonical Correlations.

CANCOR is a multivariate analysis that reveals the co-inertia between two tables that describe the same set of experimental units (or observations) with two different sets of possibly covarying variables.  The CANCOR-test analyzes simultaneously the environment at sites of origin of populations, their phenotype assessed in experimental gardens and the allelic frequencies of populations in order to identify the environmental variables imposing selection, the adaptive phenotypic responses and the adaptive loci.
